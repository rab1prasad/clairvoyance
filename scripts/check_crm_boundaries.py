"""CI guard for the app/crm module boundaries (ADR 0001 amendment).

One DB role and no schema grants, so the boundary is enforced HERE, at
PR time — earlier than a grant would fail:

  1. TABLE OWNERSHIP — a quoted crm_*/platform_* table literal may appear
     only in its owning module's db/ package (+ migrations, tests, scripts).
  2. SQL CONFINEMENT — SQL statements inside app/crm live only in
     db/queries*.py files.
  3. DRIVER CONFINEMENT — within app/crm, `import asyncpg` is legal only
     in shared/db.py and */db/ packages.
  4. IMPORT DIRECTION — app/crm never imports app.ai; buddy (app/ai,
     app/api) imports only app.crm.<module>.contracts; the data layer
     (app/database) imports neither app.ai nor app.crm (pre-existing
     legacy exceptions allowlisted, closed to additions); cross-module
     inside app/crm goes through contracts.py (or shared/) only.
  5. HANDLE DISCIPLINE — logic files pass the DbTxn handle, they never
     call query methods on it (that is db/accessor's job).
  6. MAP COMPLETENESS — every crm_*/platform_* CREATE TABLE in the
     migrations has an owner registered below.
  7. ONE BOUNDARY DOOR — raw crm_transaction()/`async with transaction()`
     is legal only inside shared/db.py; logic enters boundaries via
     atomically(...) exclusively.
  8. ATOMIC NAMING — the function passed to atomically() is named
     *_in_txn: the suffix declares "I am a boundary's body".
  9. ATOMIC DOCSTRING — every *_in_txn body opens with "ATOMIC: <what
     shares fate> — <the law>"; grep ATOMIC: is the atom inventory.
  10. HANDLES STAY DOWN — connection()/crm_connection never appears in
     logic; accessors self-scope single statements and batch loops. A
     logic file touches a handle ONLY as an _in_txn body's txn param.
  11. ADAPTER CONFINEMENT — app.crm.connectivity.providers is imported
     only by the module-root doors named in PROVIDER_DOORS and inside
     providers/ itself; any other import reaches a provider around the
     checks its door performs.
  12. RECORD HEARS, NEVER CALLS — app/crm/record imports no subscriber
     module (identity + shared only): consumers register through
     record/consumers.py from worker_main, so subscriber -> record is the
     only direction the import cycle can never form in.

New table? Add it to TABLE_OWNERS with its owning module. New violation
class? This script is the place — the boundary is code, so the check is
code.
