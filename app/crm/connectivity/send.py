"""The provider seam — the module's only path to the outside world.

Everything that must be true before a message reaches a person is checked
here, once, for every channel: the gate granted it, the channel has an
adapter, the merchant has a live pipe, the account behind it is healthy, its
credentials decrypt. Any of those missing REFUSES the send — nothing falls
through to a default, because every plausible default (another number,
another account) contacts somebody in a way they did not agree to.

The route is assembled here and handed to the adapter whole, which is what
lets an adapter be tested without a database. Adapters live behind
providers/ and are imported nowhere else — boundary rule 11 fails CI on any
other import, because a stray one reaches a provider without passing the
checks above. The same fact, greppable:

    grep -rn "connectivity.providers" app/ | grep -v "^app/crm/connectivity/providers/"

Any OTHER hit is something reaching a provider without passing the checks
above. The other two are allowed because neither sends a message: webhooks.py
RECEIVES from a provider, and subscribe.py administers an account. The law
protects the path to a customer, not every call to a vendor.

Two things this file deliberately does NOT do:

  · Decide what a failure means. It reports; dispatch.py's retry ladder
    decides. Two deciders would mean two answers to "why was this retried".
  · Write to the route tables — only READ them. Acting on a credential
    rejection (marking degraded, alerting, re-auth) belongs to channel
    lifecycle code; two owners for one lifecycle is how a status flaps.
