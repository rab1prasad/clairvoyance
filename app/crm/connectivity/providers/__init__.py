"""The adapter registry — the channel vocabulary, in code.

This dict is what the tables deliberately refuse to hold: migration 027
taught that a CHECK constraint turns "support a new channel" into a
migration, a deploy window and a rollback plan. Here a new channel is
providers/<name>.py plus one line below. Nothing else.

Imported only by the three module-root files that orchestrate provider work
— send.py (sends), webhooks.py (receives) and subscribe.py (administers an
account). That is the point of one door for adapters, and this grep should
name no others:

    grep -rn "connectivity.providers" app/ | grep -v "^app/crm/connectivity/providers/"
