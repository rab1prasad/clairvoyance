"""The parent every channel adapter inherits.

A child implements two things — build the request, read the answer — and
inherits what must never vary between channels: transport-failure
classification, address masking, and the fact that policy is not its job.

This interface is about SENDING, and deliberately only that. Receiving a
provider's callbacks is not here, because the uniformity that makes `deliver`
work outbound does not hold inbound: providers differ on whether they push or
we poll, whether they batch, how they authenticate (signature over the body,
over URL+body, a secret in the path, mTLS), and whether per-account
subscription exists at all. Worse, that variation runs per PROVIDER, not per
channel — one Meta app serves WhatsApp, Instagram and Messenger through one
callback with one signature scheme. A per-channel webhook interface would
split identical code across channel keys while leaving the axis that actually
differs unabstracted. So webhook handling lives in the provider module that
needs it, and a seam gets introduced when a second provider makes its real
shape known.

The split that matters: an adapter CLASSIFIES, it never DECIDES. It reports
what the provider did (accepted; failed, plausibly-retryable or not);
dispatch.plan_for_outcome alone turns that into queued / failed / dead.
An adapter reaching for the retry ladder would give each channel its own
private policy, and "why was this retried" would stop having one answer.
