"""The webhook door against a real Postgres and the real router.

Skipped unless a database is offered:

    createdb crm_webhook_test
    for f in app/database/migrations/*.sql; do psql -q -d crm_webhook_test -f $f; done
    CRM_WEBHOOK_TEST_DSN=postgresql:///crm_webhook_test uv run pytest \\
        tests/crm/test_webhooks_integration.py -v

Everything else about the webhook path is covered by mocks in
test_webhooks.py and test_whatsapp_adapter.py, and mocks are the right tool
for wire shapes and branch coverage. They cannot answer four questions, and
those four are all this file asks:

  1. Is the route actually mounted at the URL we tell Meta about? A unit test
     builds its own app; a typo in app/crm/api.py cannot fail it.
  2. Does the signature verify over the bytes FASTAPI hands us, rather than
     the bytes a test constructed?
  3. Is the SQL real SQL? Every query here is a string until Postgres parses
     it, and the tenancy lookup depends on an index this file's migrations
     actually build.
  4. Does the spine really dedupe a replayed callback? That is a UNIQUE
     constraint doing the work — the one part no mock can stand in for.

Meta itself is still faked (its bytes are signed here), because a test that
needed a WhatsApp Business Account would never run. scripts/dev/fake_meta.py
is the version of this that runs over real HTTP against a real server.
